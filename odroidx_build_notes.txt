Installing ROS:
	cd groovy_underlay
	git clone https://github.com/ros/message_generation.git
	git clone https://github.com/ros/message_runtime.git
	cd build/catkin_generated && ln -s ../../catkin/python/catkin



When building tf, target pytf.cpp will complain about not being able to find Python.h. Edit tf's CMakeLists.txt and manually set the include path:
	set(PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH /usr/include/python2.7)



openni-git will want to use -mfloat-abi=soft. We need to use -mfloat-abi=hard. To do so:
	* Try and fail to install openni-git. It will ask if you wish to restart the build. Say yes.
	* Edit /var/abs/local/yaourtbuild/openni-git/src/openni-build/Platform/Linux/Build/Common/Platform.Arm to include -mfloat-abi=hard instead of -mfloat-abi=softfp.
	* Edit /var/abs/local/yaourtbuild/openni-git/src/openni-build/Platform/Linux/Build/Makefile to not build any of the Java modules or samples.
	* Edit PKGBUILD to set _platform='Arm' and to not git clone the repository again to prevent it from overwriting the above changes. Also, in package(), instead of installing Linux-x86, install Linux-Arm.
	* Rebuild.




pcl-ros source does not check for the ARM architecture when determining endianness or the host byte order. The ODROID is little-endian (so says 'gcc -dumpspecs'). So pause the installation after configuration is complete and edit the following two files to simply #define PCL_LITTLE_ENDIAN and PLY_LITTLE_ENDIAN before continuing:
	/tmp/yaourt-tmp-root/aur-pcl-ros/src/PCL-1.6.0-Source/common/include/sensor_msgs/PointCloud2.h
	/tmp/yaourt-tmp-root/aur-pcl-ros/src/PCL-1.6.0-Source/io/include/pcl/io/ply/byte_order.h




Many of these packages ran make single-threaded. Try multithreading make to take advantage of the four cores.






The following happens because the build runs out of memory:

So add some swap space.




A few of these happens:

SETTING UP DISTCC:
	SERVER (i.e., fast machine):
		* Create user distcc
		* Edit /etc/rc.d/distccd and put after the functions line:
			export PATH=/opt/x-tools7h/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/bin:$PATH
		* Edit /etc/conf.d/distccd to set:
			DISTCC_ARGS="--user distcc --allow 192.168.0.0/24"
	CLIENT:
		* Edit /etc/distcc/hosts and /etc/default/distcc
		* export CC='distcc gcc'
		* export CXX='distcc g++'
		* Make sure cmake knows about the above two variables.

Problems:
	cmake/pcl_find_sse.cmake sets -march=native, which means that distcc cannot distribute the compilation processes to other machines. I tried changing this to armv7-a, but distcc still refused to distribute the work.





To get rid of errors like this one:
	/bin/sh: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)
Enable the locale in /etc/locale.gen and run locale-gen.




Building self_test (dependency of hokuyo_node) -- for some reason, it tries to link a library with -l/usr/lib/libgtest.so. This is incorrect syntax! (See man ld.) Fix it in CMakeCache.txt (though it should really be fixed elsewhere?).




Building rgbdslam:
	* Remove openni-dev dependency from /opt/ros/groovy/lib/pkgconfig/{pcl_io-1.6.pc,pcl_visualization-1.6.pc}
	* sed -i 's/pcl-1.5/pcl-1.6/g' `rospack find pcl_ros`/manifest.xml



Installing g2o-svn:
	* gcc/g++ for ARM doesn't have the -msse options. Remove it from CMakeLists.txt.
	* Looking for /usr/include/GL/gl.h? Install mesa.
	* Installing this package did not install Findg2o.cmake, which rgbdslam wants.
