	 * Calculate DCM offset.

	 * We use an accelerometer to correct for gyro drift. This means that the
	 * IMU will adjust dcm_gyro according to whatever the accelerometer thinks
	 * is gravity. However, since it is nearly impossible to mount the
	 * accelerometer perfectly horizontal to the chassis, this also means that
	 * dcm_gyro will represent the orientation of the accelerometer, not the
	 * chassis, along the X and Y rotational axes.
	 *
	 * The rotational difference between the orientations of the accelerometer
	 * (dcm_gyro) and the chassis (dcm_out) is constant and can be approximated
	 * by another rotation matrix we will call dcm_offset, which we populate with
	 * trim angles obtained during hover calibration. We rotate dcm_gyro by
	 * dcm_offset to obtain dcm_out.
	 *
	 * Keep in mind, however, that we still update the IMU based on dcm_gyro and
	 * not dcm_out. This is because it is dcm_gyro we are correcting with the
	 * accelerometer's measurement of the gravity vector, and dcm_out is only
	 * a transformation of that DCM based on dcm_offset. We use dcm_out for
	 * flight calculations, but dcm_gyro is what we keep track of within the
	 * IMU.
	 *
	 * As a final note, this is a small-angle approximation! We could do
	 * something fancy with trigonometry, but if the hardware is so poorly
	 * built (or poorly designed) that small-angle approximations become
	 * insufficient, we can't expect software to fix everything.

	 *
	 * All of this is calculated in the body frame. If w is the angular
	 * velocity vector, let w_dt (w*dt) be the angular displacement vector of
	 * the DCM over a time interval dt. Let w_dt_i, w_dt_j, and w_dt_k be the
	 * components of w_dt codirectional with the i, j, and k unit vectors,
	 * respectively. Also, let dr be the linear displacement vector of the DCM
	 * and dr_i, dr_j, and dr_k once again be the i, j, and k components,
	 * respectively.
	 *
	 * In very small dt, certain vectors approach orthogonality, so we can
	 * assume that (draw this out for yourself!):
	 *
	 *     dr_x = <    0,  dw_k, -dw_j>,
	 *     dr_y = <-dw_k,     0,  dw_i>, and
	 *     dr_z = < dw_j, -dw_i,     0>,
	 *
	 * which can be expressed as the rotation matrix:
	 *
	 *          [     0  dw_k -dw_j ]
	 *     dr = [ -dw_k     0  dw_i ]
	 *          [  dw_j -dw_i     0 ].
	 *
	 * This can then be multiplied by the current DCM and added to the current
	 * DCM to update the DCM. To minimize the number of calculations performed
	 * by the processor, however, we can combine the last two steps by
	 * combining dr with the identity matrix to produce:
	 *
	 *              [     1  dw_k -dw_j ]
	 *     dr + I = [ -dw_k     1  dw_i ]
	 *              [  dw_j -dw_i     1 ],
	 *
	 * which we multiply with the current DCM to produce the updated DCM
	 * directly.
	 *
	 * It may be helpful to read the Wikipedia pages on cross products and
	 * rotation representation.
